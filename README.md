# 2D Quantum Walk Simulation
This is a simple 2D classical random walk and quantum walk simulation project.
There are two parts of simulation:

-  Classical Random walk

   See [Classical Random Walk](https://github.com/daihui/QuantumWalkSimulation/blob/master/classicalRWMat.py)

-  Quantum walk

   See [Quantum Walk](https://github.com/daihui/QuantumWalkSimulation/blob/master/quantumRWMat.py)

Based on this simulation I have made two GIF which can do a intresting compare [Classical](https://github.com/daihui/QuantumWalkSimulation/blob/master/CRW.gif) VS [Quantum](https://github.com/daihui/QuantumWalkSimulation/blob/master/QW.gif)
